<p></p>Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery
energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.

Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor
and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was
named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car,
followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in
2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first
electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind,
globally,[7] and became the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide.
